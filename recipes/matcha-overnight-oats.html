    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oats and a matcha latte make a wonderful breakfast pairing, but this recipe goes one step further to combine them into matcha overnight oats, an effortless breakfast that will delight lovers of efficiency and morning matcha. For vibrantly colored oats and a strong matcha flavor, whisk the oat mixture with a full teaspoon of matcha powder, but feel free to decrease that amount for a more delicate flavor or lower caffeine level. Refrigerate the oat base at least 3 hours to thicken (or overnight), then adjust the desired thickness to taste, adding more milk to thin as desired. To serve, top with thick, creamy Greek yogurt and vibrant fruits of choice, like raspberries, mangoes and blueberries.</p>
